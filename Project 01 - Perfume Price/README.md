# Frontend Mentor - Product preview card component

![Design preview for the Product preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹
This is my firs project in Front End Mentor
## Links
- My project : https://gleaming-medovik-afaeac.netlify.app 
- Front End Mentro Project : https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-preview-card-component-GO7UmttRfa/hub
## Some problems 
- The font (Franceus) is not working with the link from Google Fonts
- I had to change the hover color because the project did not provide it for me
- I had some difficulties when developing the mobile version, it is better to develop mobile first.
